## What is playdrums?
Playdrums is a free and open source Node.js library with a clear and concise API mainly inspired by [Taiko](https://taiko.dev/) written by the team behind Gauge from ThoughtWorks.
It interracts with [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/), the new multiBrowser framework by the former puppeteer team now at Microsoft.
It tries to combine best of both world:
* High readability of tests
* Automate the Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers with a single API. 
* Enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.
* Headless is supported for all the browsers on all platforms.
